## How Is $1 Trading Possible?

- **Micro/Cent Accounts**: trade lots as small as 0.01 standard lots = 1,000 units of currency.  
- **High Leverage**: up to 1:500 or more amplifies buying power (use responsibly).  
- **Low Spreads**: cent accounts often have slightly wider spreads but allow tiny positions.  

---

## Risks & Limitations of $1 Accounts

- **Very small margin buffer**—easy margin call if market moves against you.  
- **Wider spreads** eat into profits.  
- **Limited strategy**: scalping only, very tight risk controls.  
- **Psychological challenge**: tiny P/L values require discipline.

## Money & Risk Management

- **Risk per trade**: ≤ 10% of your $1 balance (i.e. $0.10)—very tight.  
- **Use stop‑loss** on every position.  
- **Avoid high volatility** news events.  
- **Limit trades**: focus on 1–2 setups per session.

---

## Scaling Up from $1

- Reinvest profits to gradually increase balance.  
- Move to Standard accounts once you have ≥ $50.  
- Lower leverage as balance grows to protect capital.  
- Transition from cent‑lots to micro‑lots (0.1 lot) for larger P/L potential.
