# How to Use GitHub Copilot for Free in VS Code

While GitHub Copilot is primarily a paid subscription service, there are legitimate ways you can use it for free, at least for a limited time or with certain limitations, especially in Visual Studio Code (VS Code). This guide explains your options for accessing GitHub Copilot for free in VS Code in 2025.

## Introduction

GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered coding assistant that provides code suggestions as you type, directly within your editor like VS Code. It can significantly speed up your coding process. While the full, unlimited experience requires a paid subscription, GitHub offers ways for developers to try and use it for free under specific circumstances.

## Ways to Get GitHub Copilot for Free

Here are the main methods to access GitHub Copilot without a paid subscription in 2025:

### 1. GitHub Copilot Free Tier (Limited Access)

GitHub offers a "Copilot Free" plan. This is a tier with limited usage designed for individual developers to explore Copilot's capabilities at no cost.

* **Features:** Includes basic code completions in supported IDEs (like VS Code) and limited access to Copilot Chat.
* **Limitations:** The free tier has monthly usage limits. As of recent information in 2025, this is typically limited to a certain number of code completions per month (e.g., 2,000) and a certain number of chat requests per month (e.g., 50). Once these limits are reached, Copilot functionality will be restricted until the next billing cycle.
* **Eligibility:** Available to individual developers who do not have access to Copilot through an organization or enterprise plan.

### 2. Free Trial (Copilot Pro)

GitHub offers a free trial period for its paid plans, most commonly for **Copilot Pro**.

* **Duration:** The standard free trial is typically 30 days.
* **Features:** During the trial, you get full access to the features of the Copilot Pro plan, which includes unlimited code completions, expanded access to Copilot Chat, and access to premium models.
* **Requirement:** You usually need to sign up for the trial through your GitHub account settings. Note that a payment method might be required upfront, and the trial will automatically convert to a paid subscription after 30 days if you don't cancel before the trial ends.

### 3. Free for Verified Students, Teachers, and Open Source Maintainers

GitHub provides free access to GitHub Copilot Pro for specific members of the community:

* **Verified Students:** If you are currently enrolled as a student, you can apply for the GitHub Global Campus program. Upon successful verification of your student status, you often receive free access to various developer tools, including GitHub Copilot Pro.
* **Verified Teachers:** Educators can also apply for benefits through GitHub Education, which may include free access to Copilot Pro.
* **Maintainers of Popular Open Source Projects:** GitHub may offer free access to individuals who actively maintain popular public repositories on GitHub. Eligibility is determined by GitHub.

To qualify for these benefits, you typically need to apply and be verified through the relevant GitHub Education or program channels.

## Step-by-Step: Installing and Using GitHub Copilot Free in VS Code

Once you have successfully activated one of the free access methods (Free tier, trial, or educational/maintainer benefit) on your GitHub account, follow these steps to set it up in VS Code:

### Step 1: Ensure You Have Access on Your GitHub Account

* Go to your GitHub account settings on the GitHub website.
* Navigate to the "Copilot" section.
* Confirm that you have activated the "Copilot Free" plan, started a trial, or see that you have free access through a program like GitHub Education.

### Step 2: Install the GitHub Copilot Extension in VS Code

* Open Visual Studio Code on your computer.
* Go to the **Extensions** view by clicking the square icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X` on Windows/Linux, `Cmd+Shift+X` on macOS).
* In the search bar, type "GitHub Copilot".
* Find the official **"GitHub Copilot"** extension published by **GitHub**. There is also often a "GitHub Copilot Chat" extension; install that one too as it works alongside the main Copilot extension for conversational help.
* Click the **"Install"** button for both extensions.

### Step 3: Authorize VS Code with Your GitHub Account

* After installation, VS Code will usually prompt you to sign in to your GitHub account to activate Copilot.
* Click on the sign-in prompt (often a notification or a button in the bottom status bar or top right).
* A browser window will open, directing you to GitHub.
* Follow the instructions on GitHub to sign in to the account that has Copilot access enabled.
* Authorize the GitHub Copilot extension for VS Code to access your account.
* Once authorized, you will be redirected back to VS Code, and Copilot should become active. You might see a Copilot icon in the VS Code status bar (at the bottom).

### Step 4: Start Coding and Getting Suggestions

* Open a code file in a supported programming language (Copilot works best with widely used languages like Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C++, C#, Go, etc.).
* Begin typing code or comments.
* GitHub Copilot will automatically start suggesting code completions as you type.
* **Press `Tab`** to accept an inline suggestion.
* You can also use keyboard shortcuts (like `Alt+[` and `Alt+]` by default) to cycle through alternative suggestions if available.
* To use Copilot Chat (if installed and within limits), open the Chat view in the sidebar (usually by clicking the Copilot icon or through the View > Chat menu) and ask questions related to your code.

## Limitations of Free Access

Remember the limitations if you are using the free tier or a trial:

* **Usage Limits (Free Tier):** You are limited to a certain number of completions and chat interactions per month. You will be notified when you approach these limits.
* **Time Limit (Free Trial):** The free trial is temporary (e.g., 30 days). After the trial ends, you will need a paid subscription to continue using Copilot Pro or Copilot Pro+.
* **Feature Differences:** Copilot Free offers core features, but paid plans (Pro and Pro+) provide unlimited usage (completions/certain chat modes), access to premium AI models, and potentially more advanced capabilities.

## Conclusion

While GitHub Copilot is a paid service, you can experience its capabilities for free in VS Code by utilizing the limited "Copilot Free" tier, starting a free trial, or by qualifying for free access through GitHub Education programs (for students and teachers) or as a prominent open-source maintainer. Once you have access enabled on your GitHub account, installing the VS Code extension and authorizing it is a straightforward process. Use these free options to explore how AI pair programming can assist your workflow, but be mindful of the limitations for ongoing free access.
