If you’ve created a repository on [GitHub](https://github.com) and set it to **Private**, you might later decide to make it **Public** so others can view and contribute to your work. This guide walks you through the simple steps to change your repository’s visibility.

---

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account.  
- Ownership or admin access to the target repository.

---

## Steps

1. **Sign in to GitHub**  
   Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com) and log in with your username and password.

2. **Navigate to Your Repository**  
   - Click your profile icon (top‑right corner) and select **Your repositories**.  
   - Choose the repository you want to make public.

3. **Open the Settings Tab**  
   At the top of the repository page, click on **Settings** (⚙️ icon).

4. **Locate the “Danger Zone”**  
   Scroll down to the bottom of the Settings page. You’ll find a section titled **Danger Zone**.

5. **Change Visibility**  
   - In the Danger Zone, find **Change repository visibility**.  
   - Click **Change visibility**.

6. **Select “Make Public”**  
   - In the modal dialog, choose **Make public**.  
   - Read the warning carefully—making a repo public cannot be undone (though you can re‑privatize later, your commit history may still be visible on forks).  
   - Type the repository name to confirm and click **I understand, change repository visibility**.

7. **Verify the Change**  
   - GitHub will process the request and reload the page.  
   - You should see a green banner confirming that your repository is now public.

## After Making Your Repository Public

- **Update Documentation**: Edit your `README.md` to welcome new contributors.  
- **Configure Branch Protection**: Ensure your main branch is protected against force‑pushes or direct commits if needed.  
- **Set Up Issue & PR Templates**: Guide contributors on how to report issues or submit pull requests.
