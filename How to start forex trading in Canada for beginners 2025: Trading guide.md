## Why Trade Forex in Canada?

- **Diversify your portfolio** beyond stocks and bonds  
- **24/5 market access**—trade when North America and Europe overlap  
- **Leverage** (up to 1:30 for retail under IIROC rules) amplifies capital  
- **Hedge** against CAD volatility driven by commodities  

---

## Regulation & Safety for Canadian Traders

Canadian forex brokers must be IIROC‑registered and members of CIPF, ensuring:  
- **Segregated client funds** in Canadian banks  
- **Investor protection** up to CAD 1 000 000 under CIPF  
- **Strict compliance** with AML/KYC and capital requirements  

Always verify a broker’s IIROC membership on the IIROC website before funding.

## Key Currency Pairs & Trading Hours

- **Majors**: USD/CAD, EUR/USD, GBP/USD—tightest spreads and highest liquidity  
- **Crosses**: EUR/GBP, AUD/JPY—for diversification beyond USD pairs  
- **Exotics**: USD/TRY, USD/SEK—higher volatility, wider spreads  
- **Best hours**: 13:00–17:00 EST (London–New York overlap), excellent for CAD pairs  

---

## Choosing Your Broker

Look for:  
- **IIROC regulation** and CIPF coverage  
- **Low spreads & transparent commissions**  
- **Canadian deposit/withdrawal methods** (Interac®, EFT, credit card)  
- **Robust demo account** for risk‑free practice
